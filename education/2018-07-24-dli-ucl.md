# DLI Image Recognition and Object Detection Labs #

Within these two labs, you will learn the basics of deep learning by training and deploying neural networks. Build the skill-set and toolbox you need to build your own deep learning solutions through hands-on projects. Learners will:
* Understand general terms and background of deep learning
* Implement common deep learning workflows such as Image Classification and Object Detection
* Manipulate training parameters to improve accuracy
* Modify internal layers of neural networks to adapt to new problems
* Deploy your networks to start solving real-world problems

**Content level:** Beginner

**Pre-Requisites:** Technical background and basic understanding of deep learning concepts

* [**Lab 01**: Image Classification with DIGITS](/static/slides/2018-07-24-dl-ucl/image-classification.pdf)
