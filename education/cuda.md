# Introduction to CUDA Two Day Course #

The aim of the course is to provide a basic understanding of principles of CUDA GPU programming and GPU programming. Prior knowledge of CUDA or Parallel programming is not required. Previous knowledge of C/C++ is required in order to get the most out of the course. Familiarity with concepts such as pointers, arrays and functions is required. The course consists of approximately 3 hours of lectures and 4 hours of practical training each day. The course will be delivered by Dr. Paul Richmond (Comp Sci) with assistance from Mozhgan Kabiri Chimeh from the Research Software Engineering Sheffield group.
