# Introduction to CUDA and Deep Learning (University of Dundee) #

This course is part of the Three day Introduction to CUDA and Deep Learning with GPUs training course provided by NVIDIA and Dell and taught by [Dr Paul Richmond](http://paulrichmond.shef.ac.uk/) and Twin Karmakharm ([Research software Engineering at the University of Sheffield](http://rse.shef.ac.uk/)). The CUDA aspect of this course will take place over the first days followed by Deep Learning training on day two.

## Day 1 ##

The aim of the CUDA course is to provide a basic understanding of principles of CUDA GPU programming and GPU programming. Prior knowledge of CUDA or Parallel programming is not required. Previous knowledge of C/C++ is required in order to get the most out of the course. Familiarity with concepts such as pointers, arrays and functions is required. The course consists of approximately 2-3 hours of lectures and 3-4 hours of practical training each day.

## Day 2 Deep Learning Fundamentals ##

In this full-day workshop, you will learn the basics of deep learning by training and deploying neural networks. Build the skill-set and toolbox you need to build your own deep learning solutions through hands-on projects. Learners will:
* Understand general terms and background of deep learning
* Implement common deep learning workflows such as Image Classification and Object Detection
* Manipulate training parameters to improve accuracy
* Modify internal layers of neural networks to adapt to new problems
* Deploy your networks to start solving real-world problems

**Content level:** Beginner

**Pre-Requisites:** Technical background and basic understanding of deep learning concepts
