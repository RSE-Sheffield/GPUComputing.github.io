# Introduction to CUDA (University of Glasgow) #

This course is part of the Three day Introduction to CUDA and Deep Learning with GPUs training course provided by NVIDIA and Dell and taught by [Dr Paul Richmond](http://paulrichmond.shef.ac.uk/) and Twin Karmakharm ([Research software Engineering at the University of Sheffield](http://rse.shef.ac.uk/)). The CUDA aspect of this course will take place over the first 2 days.

The aim of the CUDA course is to provide a basic understanding of principles of CUDA GPU programming and GPU programming. Prior knowledge of CUDA or Parallel programming is not required. Previous knowledge of C/C++ is required in order to get the most out of the course. Familiarity with concepts such as pointers, arrays and functions is required. The course consists of approximately 2-3 hours of lectures and 3-4 hours of practical training each day.
