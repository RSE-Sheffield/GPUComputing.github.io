## DLI Deep Learning Fundamentals Workshop (1st November 2017)##

[NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute](http://www.nvidia.co.uk/dli) (DLI) offers hands-on training for developers, data scientists, and researchers looking to solve challenging problems with deep learning. DLI and [Research Software Engineering Sheffield](http://rse.shef.ac.uk/) (RSES) are excited to announce this one-day practical Deep Learning workshop at Computer room 4 (Room 2.06) in the Diamond on the 1st of November (9am-5.30pm) exclusively for academics, students, staff, and researchers from University of Sheffield.

In this full-day workshop, you will learn the basics of deep learning by training and deploying neural networks. Build the skill-set and toolbox you need to build your own deep learning solutions through hands-on projects. Learners will:
* Understand general terms and background of deep learning
* Implement common deep learning workflows such as Image Classification and Object Detection
* Manipulate training parameters to improve accuracy
* Modify internal layers of neural networks to adapt to new problems
* Deploy your networks to start solving real-world problems

**Content level:** Beginner

**Pre-Requisites:*** Technical background and basic understanding of deep learning concepts
