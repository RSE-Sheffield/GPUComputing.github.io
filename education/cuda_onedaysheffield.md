# Introduction to CUDA One Day Course #

The aim of the course is to provide a basic understanding of principles of CUDA GPU programming and GPU programming. Prior knowledge of CUDA or Parallel programming is not required. Previous knowledge of C/C++ is required in order to get the most out of the course. Familiarity with concepts such as pointers, arrays and functions is required. The course consists of approximately 2-3 hours of lectures and 3-4 hours of practical training. The course will be delivered by [Dr. Paul Richmond](http://paulrichmond.shef.ac.uk/) with assistance from Dr. Mozhgan Kabiri Chimeh from the [Research Software Engineering Sheffield](http://rse.shef.ac.uk/) group.
