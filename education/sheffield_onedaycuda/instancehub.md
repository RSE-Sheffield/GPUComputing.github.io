# Cloud GPU Instance with InstanceHub #

InstanceHub is a new website (you will be one of the first people to test it) which allows a trainer to provide access to AWS EC2 cloud instances. I have configured a lab which will provide you with a GPU enabled EC2 instance with the software and lab classes pre-installed. To access your instance follow the link below and signup using the email address you used to register for the course.

A description on how to use the instance is provided on the website. You can either SSH directly or use the provided Python Notebook server to create a web based terminal and edit your source files.
