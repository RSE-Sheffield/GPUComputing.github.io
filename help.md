## Research Software Consultancy ##

The Research Software Engineering (RSE) Sheffield group is able to provide short term research software consultancy for GPU Computing. It is co-run by Dr Paul Richmond who is employed on a EPSRC RSE fellowship with a specific focus on GPU computing. If you are writing a grant a require help with applying GPU computing then you can cost in a GPU expert to assist you. Your level of requirements might vary from collaborative research supervision to having dedicated short or long term staff to work on your project. We are also able to cost in administrative support for Deep Learning grants which ensure that you have dedicated support for running software on the university and national GPU facilities.

As part of RSE Sheffield we are able to privide some free short term consultancy where this is likely to lead to the development of future research outputs.
