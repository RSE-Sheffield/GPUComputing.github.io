As part of the Nvidia Deep Learning Institute Ambassador scheme, Research software Engineering Sheffield ([http://rse.shef.ac.uk](http://rse.shef.ac.uk)) will be running the first one-day Deep Learning Fundamentals workhop on the 1st of November.

Details of the workshop can be found on the [eventbrite page](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/deep-learning-workshop-nvidia-deep-learning-institute-tickets-38497642485). Although the course is now full, we intend to run the sessions more regularly starting from next year.
