## Background ## 

In the last ten years, there has been an increased drive toward the use of many-core architectures which exploit larger amounts of data parallelism. GPUs have evolved from a fixed pipeline graphics processing hardware into powerful programmable co-processing units capable of performing general purpose computing (sometimes referred to as GPGPU or General Purpose Computing on GPUs). In comparison with traditional CPU systems, a GPU is capable of far higher (theoretical) peak performance within a smaller power window and as such many of the Top 500 supercomputers are reliant on GPU (or other many-core) architectures.


## GPUComputing Sheffield ##

There is an active research of community within the University of Sheffield developing novel techniques for GPUs. There is also a growing community of researchers using GPUs for Deep Learning. Despite this there is a clear skills gap between those who are able to utilise these highly parallel architectures and those that can not. The GPUComputing Sheffield site aims to act as a University of Sheffield community portal to promote skills and software for GPU and accelerated computing. More specially the webiste give University of Sheffield members access to permanent [training material](..\education), information and advice about [using and buying hardware](..\hardware) and information of [software packages](..\software) for using and developing programs for GPUs.

## NVIDIA CUDA Research Centre ##

The GPUComputing@Sheffield group has been an NVIDIA GPU research centre since 2011 and an NVIDIA Education Centre since 2016 ([more history](http://paulrichmond.shef.ac.uk/gpu/gpucomputingatsheffield/)). The group is maintained mainly through through a [mailing-list](./mailing-list) and this website which provides information on all aspects of GPU programming, software, hardware and consultancy.
