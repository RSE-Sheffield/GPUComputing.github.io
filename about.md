## About GPUComputing@Sheffield ##

In the last ten years, there has been an increased drive toward the use of many-core architectures which exploit larger amounts of data parallelism. 

Deep Learning has emerged as a prominent technique which is able to unify abundances of parallel computing with an abundance of data.

Despite this there is a clear gap between those who are able to utilise these parallel architectures and those that do not. The GPUComputing@Sheffield site aims to act as a University of Sheffield community portal to promote skills and software for GPU and accelerated computing. 

The GPUComputing@Sheffield group has been an NVIDIA GPU research centre since 2011 and an NVIDIA Education Centre since 2016 ([more history](http://paulrichmond.shef.ac.uk/gpu/gpucomputingatsheffield/)). The group is maintained mainly through through a [mailing-list](./mailing-list) and this website which provides information on all aspects of GPU programming, software, hardware and consultancy.
