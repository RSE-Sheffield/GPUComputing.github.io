    "location": "Workroom 3 (205), The Diamond",
    "description": "In the past 6 years, we have developed the GeNN (GPU enhanced neuronal networks) framework for GPU accelerated spiking neuronal network simulations. In essence, GeNN is based on a simple design of code generation that allows a large extent of flexibility for computational models while at the same time taking care of some of the GPU specific optimisation work in the background. In this talk I will present the main features of GeNN, its design principles and show benchmarks. I will then discuss limitations, both specific to GeNN and to numerical simulation work on GPUs more generally and present some further work, including the SpineML-GeNN and Brian2GeNN interfaces. GeNN is developed within the Green Brain (http://greenbrain.group.shef.ac.uk/) and Brains on Board (http://brainsonboard.co.uk/) projects and is available under GPL v2 at Github (http://genn-team.github.io/genn/)",
