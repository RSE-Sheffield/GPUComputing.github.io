    "description": "Containerization is a lightweight virtualisation technology where users can package workflows, software, libraries and data for running on various machines with minimal loss of performance. The technology can be used a way for scientists to deploy custom software on the HPC cluster and easily share reproducible software along with their data. The talk explores the concept of containers and existing container technologies suitable for the HPC. Particular focus is given for Singularity which has recently been introduced on the new Sheffield Advance Research Computer (ShARC) cluster.,
